<h2>My Experience So Far At Blockfuse Labs</h2>
<p>Dear Emmanuel</p>

<p>I must say that my experience at Blockfus Labs so far has been npthing short of truly educative. The pace of learning is a bit on the fast side but at the same time, I am a firm believer of the 'No Pain, No Gain' mantra, so that's alright.</p>


<p>I have encountered a few challenges recently with learning CSS. The structuring of my html is quite easy but knowing what CSS element does exactly what has been a bit of a challenge. I learned abput clip-path in my personal study but I haven't understood exactly how to use it yet. I was hoping for some help regargding that this week but was sad to discover that we have to return to html exercises. I will have to exercise patience and wait a little, so that alright for now.</p>


<p>In about 5 years from now, I intend to have used the skills I gain here to achieve the 3 major things on my agenda: build an app that helps with evangelism and discipleship, build a supply-chain app, and build an app to help parents homeschool their children.</p>

<p>Yours Sincerely. <br> Adaeze Ezeh</p>
